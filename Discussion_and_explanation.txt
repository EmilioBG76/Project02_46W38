# Discussion and explanation on how the means and standard deviations of the blade 
# and tower displacements change with the wind speed and with the TI.

## Discussion and analysis of means and standard deviations below:


1.- Mean displacements change with wind speed and TI categories as follows:
a) Effect of Wind Speed:
For all TI categories, the mean blade and tower displacements increase with increasing wind speed 
up to a certain point (around 11-12 m/s).
We can also see how with higher wind speeds larger forces on the turbine are faced.
Beyond this point, the mean displacements decrease and I think it's due to
the pitch control system of the turbine that reduces the aerodynamic forces for the blades.

b) Effect of turbulence intensity (TI):
For a given wind speed, higher TI category generally leads to larger mean 
blade and tower displacements.  With higher TI we have a more turbulent wind, 
so it means we have greater variations in wind speed. 
Producing larger dynamic forces and thus larger mean displacements too.

2.- Standard deviation of displacements change with wind speed and TI as follows:    
a) Effect of Wind Speed:
The standard deviation of both, blade and m2 displacements generally
increases with wind speed up to a certain point (around 11-12 [m/s]), 
and then we see that decreases.
So this behavior is similar to what it's observed for the mean displacements.

b) Effect of turbulence intensity (TI):
Higher TI category results in a larger standard deviations in both blade and 
m2 displacements for all wind speeds.
This is due to higher turbulence reached with higher wind speed values.
Larger variations in wind speed are translated into larger variations 
in aerodynamic forces.  Turbine structure will oscillate more, 
an so we have the higher standard deviation in displacements.

In summary, both increasing wind speed (up to a certain point) and increasing 
turbulence intensity lead to larger means and standard deviations in the blade and
m2 displacements. This aspect indicates greater structural response and dynamic 
loading on the wind turbine. The pitch control system for the blades plays 
an important role mitigating these effects when we are facing high wind speeds.


## I have compared results obtained with TI=0.05 and TI=0.15 observing the following:

1.- Mean Displacements:
When comparing the mean displacements for TI=0.05 and TI=0.15 across different 
wind speeds, it’s observed that the mean displacements are generally larger 
for TI=0.15 than for TI=0.05.  It can be seen that this difference is more pronounced at higher 
wind speeds before the effect of pitch control becomes to be significant.

2.- Standard Deviation of Displacements:
The difference in standard deviation of displacements between TI=0.05 and TI=0.15
is even more significant. The plots obtained show that the standard deviations 
for TI=0.15 are quite a lot higher than for TI=0.05 across all wind speeds values. 
This is the most direct impact of increased turbulence.

In summary, increasing the Turbulence Intensity from TI=0.05 to TI=0.15 leads to:
A general increase in the mean displacements of both the blade and m2.
A much more significant increase in the variability of these displacements as indicated 
by the higher standard deviations.
